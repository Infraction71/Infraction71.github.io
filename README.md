## Overview
A couple of my favorite things in the world is traveling and hockey, so I thought it would be appropriate to talk about that here.


## Useful Websites 
Here are some useful websites that I have fond would be useful for both traveling and hockey. Most of these are just a great way to brun time.
 * [SeatGuru](https://www.seatguru.com/) is a website that tracks every airline and every seat configuration. Ever wonder what seat you should or should not pick? Seatguru can tell you the dimensions of every seat, as well as things like if there is a missing window.
 * [FlightAware](https://flightaware.com/) is a intresting website. It tracks every airplane in the air. It can be good for tracking someoene's flight, or just looking around in general. 
 * [HockeyDB](http://www.hockeydb.com/) is a website that tracks every player and league at about any level past high school hockey. Do you know someone who played hockey at a fairly compettive level? This website probably has their information. Do you wonder if your city ever had a hockey team? HockeyDB has that too. 

 
 ### Trips

I have been fortuante enough to go on many trips. Here is a top five:
1. Japan
2. Scotland
3. Vancouver
4. Dominican Republic
5. Denver


I went on two major trips in 2019. The first was studying abraod in Birmingham England, which was pretty incrediable. Why was it awesome? Well, it looked a bit like this:

The second trip was to the NHL winter classic, in Dallas, TX. The Winter Classic is an outdoor hockey game played on New Year's Day. My team, the Nashville Predators, played in the game. The following is a pciture of the stadium just prior to puck drop, all 85,000 of us.
